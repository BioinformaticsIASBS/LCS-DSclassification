Authors: Alireza Abdi, Masih Hajsaeedi, Mohsen Hooshmand

This code is written with python 3.8 for the paper with the above title. This version returns the LCS's length, not the LCS. 

The dataset contains six benchmarks, ACO-Rat, ACO-Random, ACO-Virus, ES, BB, and SARS-CoV-2.

To run the code in windows, do the following instruction:

1. extract datasets and code in the same folder
2. open cmd in the corresponding folder
3. type the following command in cmd: python UB-HH.py <dataset name> <beam width>

An example: python UB-HH.py ACO-Rat 200
note: When writing the name of the dataset, make sure that it exactly matches the above names.

Pleas, feel free to contact us if you have any questions about the paper or implementation.
